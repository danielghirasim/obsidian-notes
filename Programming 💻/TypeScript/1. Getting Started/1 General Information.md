TypeScript is a programming language that builds up on JavaScript and you could say that this is taking JS to the next level.

With TS you can write less error prone, cleaner code and use new features that do not exist in JS.

We will learn here TS from scratch.

One disadvantage of TS is that browsers cannot execute TS. Typescript is a tool which has a compiler that compiles TS code to JS

How can TS can add new features if in the end we have regular JS ? By the compiler compiling that easier way to a more complex JS snippet that we would have to write otherwise.

TS also adds a feature to the JS language which will give you an opportunity to use types.

TypeScript adds :

- Types (we have to be way more explicit about how things work and can avoid unexpected errors)
- Use modern IDE's which can pick up on these types better autocompletion before we compile our code
- New features : next-gen JS features which get compiled down to JS code to workarounds that works in older browsers (a bit like BABEL but already built into TS)
- Adds certain features that only TS understand like Interfaces and Generics that can't be compiled into JS but don't have to because it is only used in development
- Gives us meta programming features like decorators
- Rich configurable options
